          <h2>Mermaid Down</h2>
          <figcaption>
            <p>
              Two old trawler fishermen decide to sell a mermaid's body parts
              for millions of dollars. After a week-long stakeout at sea, a man
              in a boat sees them catch a mermaid. The man climbs on board as
              the mermaid escapes overboard. One of the fisherman dies, but the
              mermaid is recaptured. Once the mermaid's tail has been cut off
              the stowaway's presence is discovered. He barters with the
              fisherman for the mermaid, before killing him and taking the
              mermaid's human half away. The man, Dr. Beyer, a 'psychiatrist',
              documents the process of the mermaid growing a pair of human legs.
              Once the transformation is complete, Dr. Beyer places the mermaid
              in his mental institution for further observation.
