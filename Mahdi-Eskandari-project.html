              Maybe you don't like mice either, but we recommend that you
              definitely watch the movie Chef Mouse. The movie of this cute
              mouse was made in 2007 and it made Paris look more beautiful and
              ratatouille became more delicious and popular. The story of the
              movie Remy is an ambitious mouse who wants to become a chef. He
              wants to become the greatest chef in Paris, but such a thing seems
              impossible for a mouse. Especially since none of those around him
              believe in him and his dream. But by chance, Remy befriends a boy
              named Alfredo, who is a pado in a famous restaurant, and sneakily
              tries to tamper with the food and change the seasonings. Little by
              little, in this restaurant there is a place for the chef mouse or
              Remy...

              Tangled animation is one of the best animations in the world,
              whose charming and comedic story attracted the attention of all
              girls from the very beginning. In this animation, unlike stories
              like Cinderella and Snow White, Disney drew attention to a
              fighting and funny girl who saved herself. The story of the movie
              Rapunzel is a beautiful girl with long golden hair who lives alone
              at the top of a tower. His mother, who is a mysterious woman,
              comes there every day for a few hours and spends time with him.
              The problem is that Rapunzel has never left the tower before and
              is afraid to do so because, according to her mother, there are
              scary people out there who will hurt her. Another issue is his
              very long hair, which his mother does not allow him to cut. After
              some time, a stranger is found around the tower, who asks Rapunzel
              to let her hair down and lift her up...

              doesn't get along well with them and as a father, he is a stranger
              to his children. To this should be added the personal problems of
              Tim and Ted as two brothers. There is still a bit of humor with
              this story, but it is not so mouth-watering.

            Pixar's best works, it is better than many recent animes due to its
            engaging story and stunning visuals.

            At the beginning of Rooh animation, it seems that we are facing a
            repetitive story, which can still be attractive and impressive: a
            person who strives to achieve his personal goals, but the
            surrounding environment has created serious obstacles for him to
            achieve these goals. In this animation, we are faced with the story
            of a two-person journey: an apparently experienced person who thinks
            he knows the answers to his questions, and a more raw person who is
            looking for answers. During this journey, both people are supposed
            to achieve balance. With these features, Pixar's latest animation
            deserves all the praise it has received from critics and audiences,
            as well as all the awards it has won.

            Jazz pianist and music guru Joe Gardner is transported to The Great

            being, Joe becomes the mentor of another soul known only as 22.
            Together they return to Earth to discover what makes life
